# Vibration of circular plates with free edges

This script can be used to obtain the coefficients (lambda_mn and C_mn) to compute the natural frequencies and vibration modes of circular plates with free edge boundary condition.

It is based on the same approach used for circular plates with elastic edge support described by:
    - Zagrai, A., & Donskoy, D. (2005). A “soft table” for the natural frequencies and modal parameters of uniform circular plates with elastic edge support. Journal of Sound and Vibration, 287(1-2), 343-351.
    - Shared MATLAB [code](https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/6474-natural-frequencies-of-a-circular-plate)

The code was validated with the results presented in the following papers:
    - Itao, K., & Crandall, S. H. (1979). Natural modes and natural frequencies of uniform, circular, free-edge plates.
    - Amabili, M., Pasqualini, A., & Dalpiaz, G. (1995). Natural frequencies and modes of free-edge circular plates vibrating in vacuum or in contact with liquid. Journal of sound and vibration, 188(5), 685-699.
